 * Changed default of the estimation ls method. Now, the default is wls. If row.weights and col.weights arguments are NULL, then weights are respectivaly - square root of the sum of frequences marginal rows by total frequences and one by square root of the sum of frequences marginal columns by total frequences.
 * The output of the budget proportions are decreasing ordered and the mixing parameters and lantent components follow this planning.
 * The file pregnancy.Rd is properly described.

2016-06-22 vs. 1.7 - Ivan Bezerra Allaman <ivanalaman@gmail.com>
 * Added row obj[obj==0] <- 1e-4 in lba.mle.fe function.
 * Fixed bug in constrainAB function. Corrected aux1 < 1 to aux1 <=1.

2016-06-11 vs. 1.5 - Ivan Bezerra Allaman <ivanalaman@gmail.com>
 * Bug in the lba.formula function corrected. The instruction length(length(var.row1)) in the line 69 was wrong. Changed to length(var.row1).
 * Update code of the print.lba, print.goodnessfit, summary.goodnessfit and summary.lba functions 

2016-03-17 vs. 1.4 - Ivan Bezerra Allaman <ivanalaman@gmail.com>
 * Included print method to lba functions.
